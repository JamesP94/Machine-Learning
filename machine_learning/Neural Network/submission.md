The MSE for the three models is as follows:

small model MSE: 120189866794498
medium model MSE: 136484937514546
large model MSE: 113006033122279

The large model has the smallest MSE and therefore performs the best. I think it performs the best because the calihospital financial dataset is large, and complex and the large model has the most hidden units. The higher number of hidden units allows it to capture subtler relationships and interactions among features that smaller models might miss.

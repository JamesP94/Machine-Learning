# ADA Clustering In-Class & Assignment

This repo holds the clustering code that we'll use in class and will
also be the place you put your clustering assignment. I have included
code that does clustering both in Python and R. 

This repo includes the following files: 

* `Clustering Assignment.ipynb`: This is the assignment for this week.
* `Clustering Surveys.ipynb`: We'll go through this code in class.
* `Clustering Surveys-Solutions.ipynb`: The solutions to the in-class work. 
* `clustering_code.py`: Helper functions from "Data Science from Scratch" that
perform K-means clustering. 
* `linear_algebra.py`: More code from DSFS, which has the needed linear algebra
functions that we use. 
* `r-examples/`: A folder that holds R versions of all of this code. 
* `survey_responses.txt`: The results of annual class surveys, building up 
a data set to perform clustering on. I'll post an updated version to Moodle 
if more results come in. 
* `washington_survey_data.txt`: Data for the assignment.

## Feedback 

In the first clustering I say "Briefly describe the clusters. How evenly do your clusters align with the regions?". Do that.

While you're at it, but the information for the second clustering in a write-up. I think the code all looks good, though.
